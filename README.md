# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
I created a site that helps families living in Louisville, KY find fun things to do and places to throw birthday parties at.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
Some of the class(es) I created are:

1. .waterfront
  It centers the picture of my husband and daughter at the waterfront and makes it a circle instead of a square.

2. .maps
  It center the map's I put on my page.

3. .main-header
  I created a header on my main page that had a map of Louisville in the background and then applied a colored gradient on top of it that faded from dark orange to transparent.
```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. myFunction
  It shows a dropdown menu when you click on the "Menu" button at the top-right of partyvenues.html.

2. myMap & myMarker
  These two functions place a map on my partyvenues.html page, using a google maps API key, and overlay a marker
  which pinpoints the exact location of the business I am referring to. I also animated the marker so it bounces when the user hovers over it.

```
